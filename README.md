# article-drafts
## Grammicode's blog.
Here we write the articles for the Grammicode Blog. When we write the articles, we follow these instructions:
### 1. Write.
First, you write the articles. There should always be a title, subheading description, and body. When you are finished, move on to step
### 2. Proofread.
After you are done, proofread the message. Label your commit "Proofread (article file)". Wait for a comment by "austin-fl-grammi" that proves you can move on to step
### 3. Push.
When you get the approval, push the file to the "waiting-publishment" branch. When a pull request comes through, the files will be pushed to the "master" branch.
## Write some articles!
Not all articles will be accepted. If an article is not specific enough, or covers to small of a detail, it is sent to the "dump" branch, where it will be deleted. Now get writing!
